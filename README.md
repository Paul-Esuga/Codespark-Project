# 🎓 PAU Student Business Hub

A hackathon project for **CodeSpark**, this platform aims to be a central hub where students at **Pan-Atlantic University (PAU)** can easily discover, explore, and connect with student-run businesses on campus.

## 🧠 Overview

With so many businesses started by students at PAU, it’s easy for them to go unnoticed amidst overwhelming email threads and limited visibility. This platform bridges that gap by giving all student businesses a centralized, aesthetic, and easy-to-navigate space — enabling students to:

- **Find services and products faster** (like lab coats, snacks, grooming, etc.)
- **Support their peers’ ventures**
- **Discover new or unofficial listings**

This platform benefits both **business owners** (by extending their reach) and **students** (by streamlining the discovery process).
